<h1>CMPUT 379, Assignment 2, HTTP Protocol</h1>



</center>

The simplified HTTP 1.1 protocol for this assignment is relatively
straightforward. The server must listen on the desired port, and
service an HTTP 1.1 connection each time a client connects to it. The
client is expected to send a request,
and the server must send either a successful response, or an error
response. For your assignment, your server is only required to
implement the GET request and response, with a few key error messages
in certain situations. HTTP requests and replies are quite simple, they
consist of multiple
lines, where each line is terminated by a line feed (\n) OR a carriage
return and linefeed together (\r\n). A request, or reply, consists of:

<ul>



 
  <li> An initial line (The request, or the response code)
  </li>



  <li> Zero or more header lines (Header: Header Value)
  </li>



  <li> A blank line (\n, or \r\n on a line by itself)
  </li>



  <li> Optional message data (in your case, the contents of a file, or an error message)
  </li>



</ul>





A <span style="font-weight: bold;">request</span> will come from the client as multiple lines of input, and look 
like this:

<pre><tt>GET /someplace/file.html HTTP/1.1<br>From: someuser@somewhere.org<br>User-Agent: Bloatzilla/7.0<br>[blank line here]<br></tt></pre>



This is a request from the client to obtain the file "<span style="font-family: monospace;">someplace/file.html</span>"
inside
the document directory specified on startup. The only part of the
request
your program need worry about is the GET line, and then discard
everything
up to, and including, the blank like at the end of the request. (you
must however, notice that the request is correctly terminated by a
blank line).
Notice also that the leading slash "/" character in the GET request
refers to the&nbsp; directory of where the documents are stored (it is
<span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> the root directory of the&nbsp;filesystem). In this sense, the file
names in the GET request are relative to the server's documents
directory. So, if for example your server's documents directory is
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/some/where/documents</span> then the request in the above example is for the document
<span style="font-family: monospace;">/some/where/documents/someplace/file.html</span> <br>


<br>


Note that on GET requests, for the purposes of this assignment your server may
ignore all the header data on the requests. You will need to correctly test
that the request is terminated by a blank line. 
<br>

<br>


Notice that because of its compatibility with the HTTP/1.1 protocol,
your servers should be able to cope just fine with requests sent by
your browser of choice. That is, you should be able to test your
servers by using any respectable web browser out there. For example,
assuming you are using the browser on the same host that your server is
running, the request can be sent by the following
URL:&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">http://localhost:PORT/someplace/file.html</span> where PORT is the
port on which your server is listening.<br>



<br>



Assuming the server can send the file "<span style="font-family: monospace;">someplace/file.html</span>" the following <span style="font-weight: bold;">response</span> will be sent to the client:

<pre><tt>HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>Date: Mon, 21 Jan 2008 18:06:16 GMT<br>Content-Type: text/html<br>Content-Length: 1234<br><br>This is the contents of file.html<br>it would continue for exactly 1234 bytes<br></tt></pre>





Your server can always return "<span style="font-family: monospace;">Content-type: text/html</span>" - it must
return the correct Date, and Content-Length header on all replies.  
There is a blank line between the end of the headers and the start of
the file.

Your server may assume that anything after the GET and the leading /
in the request is the name of a file to be retrieved - You do NOT need
to support any arguments for CGI scripting or any other strange things
you may have knowledge of in HTTP - All your server need do is serve
up files with GET, and you may safely assume that all valid requests
will start with GET, have a path to a file starting with a leading /,
and then end with HTTP/1.1. A Get with multiple things
between the GET and the HTTP/1.1 can be considered a Bad Request as
below.
<p>
 If the server receives a request it does not understand (Anything not
a GET request, or not ending in " HTTP/1.1")
It must return a BAD REQUEST error, which can look exactly like this:

</p>



<pre>HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request<br>Date: Mon, 21 Jan 2008 18:06:16 GMT<br>Content-Type: text/html<br>Content-Length: 107<br><br>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;Malformed Request&lt;/h2&gt;<br>Your browser sent a request I could not understand.<br>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br></pre>





If the server receives a request for a file that does exist, it must return
a Not Found error - which can look exactly like this:

<tt>
<pre>HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found<br>Date: Mon, 21 Jan 2008 18:06:16 GMT<br>Content-Type: text/html<br>Content-Length: 117<br><br>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;Document not found&lt;/h2&gt;<br>You asked for a document that doesn't exist. That is so sad.<br>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br></pre>



</tt>If the server receives a request for a file that is not permitted
to be read, it must return a Forbidden error - which can look exactly
like this:
<tt></tt>
<pre><tt>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden<br>Date: Mon, 21 Jan 2008 18:06:16 GMT<br>Content-Type: text/html<br>Content-Length: 130<br><br>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;Permission Denied&lt;/h2&gt;<br>You asked for a document you are not permitted to see. It sucks to be you.<br>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br></tt></pre>





If the server has some sort of unplanned error while servicing a
request, it must attempt to return a Server Error message - which can
look exactly like this:

<tt></tt>
<pre><tt>HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error<br>Date: Mon, 21 Jan 2008 18:06:16 GMT<br>Content-Type: text/html<br>Content-Length: 131<br><br>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;Oops. That Didn't work&lt;/h2&gt;<br>I had some sort of problem dealing with your request. Sorry, I'm lame.<br>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br></tt></pre>






A more full implementation of the HTTP 1.1 protocol is possible, but
not required for this assignment. For more background reading on the HTTP 1.1 see
<a href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/">HTTP Made Really Easy</a>. 
just remember that you are <em>NOT</em> expected to implement the entire HTTP 1.1 protocol in your server, only GET for files and error handling
as outlined above. 

<p>Note also that except for browsers, you can also test your server by using telnet to connect to your server's
port, and typing in the HTTP request manually. ie. <tt>telnet localhost 9990</tt>
