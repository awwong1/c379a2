<h2><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Objective</span></h2>

<p>
For this assignment you will implement a small simplified web server
which implements a minimal subset of the HTTP 1.1 protocol. Your task
is to both implement this web server, in three different ways, and to
discuss some comparisons of your implementation.  This assignment
will expose you to many issues related to writing daemons and network
servers. 
</p>


<p>
The web server is started with three command line arguments - the first 
is the TCP port it will listen for, and accept connections on for service.
The second is a directory in which the server serves up documents from. 
the third is a log file in which the server logs all transactions
with all clients. 
</p>


<h4 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The Web Servers</h4>



<p>
You must implement three servers. <strong style="font-family: monospace;">server_f</strong>,<span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span><strong style="font-family: monospace;">server_p</strong><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>, and <strong style="font-family: monospace;">server_s</strong>. Each
server is invoked in exactly the same way. An example invocation:

</p>


<pre><tt>
server_f 8000 /some/where/documents /some/where/logfile
</tt></pre>




would invoke&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">server_f </span>listening on the local machine on port 8000, serving
up documents from the directory <span style="font-family: monospace;">/some/where/documents</span>, and logging transactions to <span style="font-family: monospace;">/some/where/logfile</span>

<ul>



  <li> Servers must properly <em>daemonize</em> on startup.
  </li>


  <li> The servers should place no limit on the size of file they can send to the client. 
  </li>


  <li><strong style="font-family: monospace;">server_f</strong> must be implemented using processes and
    <tt>fork(). </tt>That is, <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_f</span> must fork a child process to service
each request it gets from the network.
  </li>


  <li><strong style="font-family: monospace;">server_p</strong> must be implemented using
    <tt>pthreads</tt>. In <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_p</span>&nbsp;each request from the network must be
serviced in a different posix thread. 
  </li>


  <li><strong style="font-family: monospace;">server_s</strong> must be implemented in one process
    <em>without</em> using threads and <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> forking a child for each request it gets from the network. Instead, <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_s</span> should use <tt>poll()</tt> or
    <tt>select()</tt> keeping track of the state of each connection to
handle all the network requests in one process.
  </li>


</ul>



<p>
The servers all accept and respond to client requests as documented
<a href="http://bofh.srv.ualberta.ca/beck/c379/asg2_p.html">here</a>
</p>


<p>
The server log all connections to themselves as documented
<a href="http://bofh.srv.ualberta.ca/beck/c379/asg2_l.html">here</a>

</p>


<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Questions</h2>


	Imagine you were using your assignment as a basis for a web
server you were going to implement into production use. You may
consider any kind of application a web server is used on, from a
Desktop PC, an ISP providing web services for many customers, all the way to
an embedded device with limited resources. You may consider the
possible extended features such a device might require (or not
require), and you may do a little bit of research on the Internet. There are
no right and wrong answers here, we are looking for answers which demonstrate
your understanding of how each implementation works in conjunction with
the operating system.    

<ul>

  <li><strong>Question 0</strong> What server did you find easiest to
implement, and hardest to implement, and why? - describe the challenges
you faced in implementing each one.
  </li>

  <li><strong>Question 1</strong> When might it be advantageous (on
what type of system) to use the design of <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_f</span> instead of <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_p</span>,
and vice versa. Explain your answer and provide some evidence for your
statements. </li>

  <li><strong>Question 2</strong> When would it be advantageous (on
what type of system) to use the design of <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_p</span> instead of <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_s</span>,
and vice versa. Explain your answer and provide some evidence for your
statements.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Marking</h2>

This assignment will be marked out of 100 marks.
<ul>

  <li>Your <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_f</span> implementation will be worth 30 marks
  </li>

  <li>Your <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_p</span> implementation will be worth 30 marks
  </li>

  <li>Your <span style="font-family: monospace;">server_s</span> implementation will be worth 25 marks
  </li>

  <li>Your answers to the questions will be worth 15 marks.</li>

</ul>

<h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Deliverables</h2>

Your programs must be written exclusively in C. C++ idioms will be
penalized. Consistent and readable C coding style is very important to
spotting
bugs and having your code readable by others. Your coding style should
comply with the code style standards documented <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=style">here.</a>
 Some (but not all) important highlights
from this which will be relevant for you are:
<ul>
<li>indentation is an 8 space TAB
</li><li>NO line may be longer than 80 chars.
</li><li>secondary indentation (for long lines) is four spaces.
</li><li>Tab should be used in place of all 8 spaces. (i.e. do not
indent a block 3 deep with 24 space characters - use three tabs)
</li><li>all functions are prototyped
</li><li>all variables are declared at the start of a block
</li><li>C style comments must be used (not C++ style)
</li></ul>

If you find that the 8 space tab and 80 column width means you are
constrained and end up with blocks indented to the far right of your screen,
that is <em>actually the point</em> of this. If you are nested that
deep, either your code logic is getting too complex and you're either barking
up the wrong tree, or you should refactor some of it (like putting
some stuff into a function, etc. This style may be painful at first
but it will make you a better C programmer.
<p>
You must deliver the code for the three servers, as well as a <span style="font-family: monospace;">Makefile</span>
to build them all, where the command "<span style="font-family: monospace;">make all</span>" will build all three
servers.
</p>


<p>

The answers to the questions must be in a file named "<span style="font-family: monospace;">questions.txt</span>"
and are limited to an <strong>absolute maximum</strong> of <strong>500
words</strong> as determined by the <tt>wc -w</tt> command in the lab
- Answers longer than 500 words <strong>WILL NOT BE MARKED</strong>
This means that before you submit "<span style="font-family: monospace;">questions.txt</span>" run <tt>wc -w
questions.txt</tt> - if the number you see is bigger than 500, your
answers are too long and you need to shorten them.

</p>


<p>
The exact way of submitting your solutions will be explained by the TA's
 in the lab and on eclass. At this stage of your CS education,
you are expected to deliver good quality code, which is easy to read
and comprehend. The quality of your code will be marked.</p>
