</center>

<p>
Your server must log successful and failed requests in a specific format. 
</p>


<p>
A request is successful when the client asks for a file, the file is
found and successfully written<span style="font-style: italic;"> in it's entirety</span> to the socket that
the client is connected on. 
</p>


<p>
Anything else happening is an error. 
</p>


<p>
For each request, the time of the request must be recorded as it is
completed (successfully or not), as well as what happened, this can be
"<span style="font-family: monospace;">200 OK </span>BYTES_WRITTEN/TOTAL_BYTES" for a file send, or the HTTP error
code for other errors. Note that this means that if the client
disconnects before the entire file can be written out on the socket,
BYTES_WRITTEN may be less that TOTAL_BYTES which would be the size of
the file.
</p>


<p>
Log format must be:
</p>


<pre><tt>
Date[tab]Client IP address[tab]request line[tab]response code
</tt></pre>




Note that [tab] is the ASCII character whose value is 9.
So the log must look something like this
<pre><tt>
